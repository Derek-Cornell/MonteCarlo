The goal of this program is to produce a running application that when given historical data of a stock option, will produce monte carlo simulations of the option price in the future to determine a fair price for the option. An option will also be available for the user to split the historical stock data into two sets so that one (the larger set) can be used for pricing and the other can be used for backtesting.
